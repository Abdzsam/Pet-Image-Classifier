# Pet-Image-Classifier
This project is a pet image classification system implemented in Python. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of pets and determine whether the pet in the image is a dog and identify its breed. The project is organized into multiple modules to handle different aspects of the classification process.
